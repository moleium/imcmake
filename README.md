## Building

To build the porject, follow these:

1. Clone this repo recursively, for example `git clone --recursive https://github.com/MoleSchizo/imcmake`
2. Create a `build` directory inside the repository and navigate to it
3. Run `cmake ..` to generate the build files, for example `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ../`.
4. Run `make` to build it 

After building the project you should have an executable (or a solution, etc..) in the current directory
